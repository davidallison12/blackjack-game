Also known as Twenty-One, Blackjack is known as one of the most popular and attractive casino card games due to its simplicity and approachability to even the novice player. The objective of Blackjack is through the use of a 52-card pack(we use a 6-deck game), for each player to attempt to beat the dealer. This is done by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.  

In the game, aces are worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10 and numbered cards are worth their value(eg. 2 of Hearts = 2). As this is a game played in casinos, bets are typically made on each hand. For the sake of simplicity, this game does not feature bets, at this time. 

## Why I Made It

I typically am not someone who gambles often or is saavy with most card games. I, however, have even found Blackjack to be a fun and approachable game to play and if I were to go to a casino it is even my first choice of game to play. Blackjack although simple in nature, has a lot of moving part that in real life, the dealer or player is typically responsible for. These things include counting, dealing, decisions, on the best possible move in certain situations, and managing the houses rules of play. 

I thought this would be a fun way of solidifying my knowledge of JavaScript and a lot of the concepts involved in using objects and object-oriented programming. Doing a game like Blackjack also allows for a lot of feature updates in order to expand and make the game more robust.

Above are my wireframes for my game. Admittedly, I will say as of now, my game does not look like the images. In looking to make the game more single-player at the moment, I decided to move a lot of the displays and butttons around to make better use of the negative space. In future iterations of the game, I will look to update the game to be a better representation of the wireframes shown.
